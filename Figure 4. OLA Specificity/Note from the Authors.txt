Figure 4. is a representative figure for the nature of specificity observed across studies during the investigations in the work presented.
All data stored in the repository presents both the yellow and green channels which correspond to wild-type probe fluorescence (HEX) and 
mutant probe fluorescence (FAM), respectively. Observation of any of these data will demonstrate the observed specificity. For example,
the limit of detection studies for p(OLA-PCR) could act as a surrogate for the data presented in figure 4: mutant DNA target (ML278) was 
spiked into the samples investigated and non-specific amplification was monitored in the yellow channel.
